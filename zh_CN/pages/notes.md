# Reading Notes


## Notes about what?
This is a place to put my collection of reading (not only technical) notes about books/blogs.
It's so personal so I will tend to be subjective and use both English and Chinese as I like.


## Operating System Three Easy Pieces
+ Pretty interesting book. It divided the OS concepts into virtualization, concurrency
and persistence. It's simple, elegant and newbie friendly. My notes are
emphasized on concurrency part. [notes are here][tep]

## Pro Git
+ Only covered the book's first three chapters. I wrote the notes in 2012, and mostly
are copy/paste from the book. [notes are here][progit]  

## Network Security with OpenSSL
+ A good intro about practical cryptography. The OpenSSL version of the book is
a little bit outdated (0.9.7) but it not affect explaining common concepts of
network security. [ntoes are here][openssl]
