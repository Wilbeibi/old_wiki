# Reading Notes


## Notes about what?
This is a place to put my collection of reading (not only technial) notes about books/blogs.
It's so personal so I will tend to be subjective and use both English and Chinese as I like.


## Operating System Three Easy Pieces
+ Pretty interesting book. It divided the OS concepts into virtualization, concurrency
and persistence. It's simple, elegant and newbie friendly. My notes are
emphasized on concurrency part. [notes are here][tep]

## Pro Git
+ Only covered the book's first three charpters. I wrote the note in 2012, and mostly
are copy/paste from the book. [notes are here][progit]
